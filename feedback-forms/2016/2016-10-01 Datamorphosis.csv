Wallsend,learning worksheets,Yes definitely,"Yes, lots","Get started quicker/ on time. Hear more from Dan and David about the projects that they had made – a short presentation from each of them would have been inspiring.
Hear about what happened at the previous event – it felt like there was a kind of assumption that people had been at it when not everyone had; initially I felt like I wasn’t part of the group.

Interesting to observe the difference in approach and good for us to think about things in a different way, but I think how people regard data is so politicised that at some point you have to consider the implications of what is shared and how the mode of sharing affects who will access it."
