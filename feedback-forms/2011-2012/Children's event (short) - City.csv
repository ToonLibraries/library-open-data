The facilitators were friendly, courteous and helpful. My children (aged 4 and 15 months) enjoyed the activities and we left with lots of things to show daddy. It was even more impressive as it was free for such an engagin activity with no time limit and lovely things to take home. Thank you to everyone involved in organising the event. Gung ho fat choi!"
