# Unrefined data
We have so much data... and so little time to format it properly, with explanations of what the data sets are. But we think that should not be an excuse for not publishing the data. We have therefore decided to publish here both our "tidied-up" data (with their accompanying explanations) and as much as we could of our "unrefined" data (where we have had time to add the metadata you may need to make sense of it all).

If you are interested in particular data sets but they're the "unrefined" ones and need more information about them, please do feel free to get in touch.
