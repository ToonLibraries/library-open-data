# Newcastle Libraries open data
We have so much data... and so little time to format it properly, with explanations of what the data sets are. But we think that should not be an excuse for not publishing the data. We have therefore decided to publish here both our "tidied-up" data (each set with their accompanying explanations) and as much as we could of our "unrefined" data (where we have not had time to add the metadata you may need to make sense of it all).

If you are interested in particular data sets ("tidied-up" or "unrefined") and need more information about them, please do feel free to get in touch.
